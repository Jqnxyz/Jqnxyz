# Hi, I'm Zen
I enjoy street photography, and listening to music on vinyl. As pretentious as it sounds, I will be adament that I do it out of appreciation of the art forms, the process, and because they bring me joy.

Oh and I also do the whole coding thing. That should be the headline actually..

Do enjoy the following photo of my wonderful girl. Her name's Yuuko!
